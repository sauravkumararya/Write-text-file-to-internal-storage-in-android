# Write-text-file-to-internal-storage-in-android
In this repo code, i will save a string to the internal storage of our device. i will use a FileOutputStream to save the data in bytes. Then i use a FileInputStream and a BufferedReader to read them back into our app and rebuild our string using a StringBuilder. i will also catch any IOExceptions.
